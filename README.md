## Inspiration
Nowaday, the threats of cyber security attacks have increased tremendously. When you watch TV or news, you can see many reports of many people being scammed or attacked online. In order to increase cyber security awareness and teach people about this topic in a fun way, we want to introduce Spammy, a game that teaches people about cyber security in a fun way.

Further, in order to protect people's security, we also provide free movement detection service on our website.

## What it does
Spammy is a game about Spammy, a cute fox, who likes adventure. Spammy is the symbol of Firefox and other web browsers that we use and we can get attacked online through those web browsers. As Spammy travels, he can meet traps. If Spammy falls into a trap, he needs to learn about cyber security to get out of the trap. Spammy can also earn rewards by eating food.

Beside the game, we also provide a free security camera service that takes screenshots of human's movements and stores them in a folder on your computer.

## How we built it
We built our site using HTML, CSS, Javascript. We built the game using HTML, python, and flowlab. We built the free security camera by using OpenCV, Machine Learning, and Python to build the detection model. We built our chatbot using Twilio. 

## Twilio
We built the chatbot using Twilio to intake information of customers through text message

## Domain
spammy.tech

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to build the games and the quizzes in a short amount of time. We could build only one level of the game because of the time constraint. We had challenges to debug the bugs in the machine learning model code.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build a game that can teach people about cyber security. We were able to build the camera detection service.

## What we learned
We learnt to build the game in  python and flowlab. We learnt to develop the model for a security camera.

## What's next for Spammy
We would like to add more levels for the games and add more quizzes for the game
